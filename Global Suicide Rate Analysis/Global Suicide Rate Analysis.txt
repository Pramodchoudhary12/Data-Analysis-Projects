1) Find MALE, FEMALE and TOTAL Suicides on 5 year intervels 
WITH male_suicides_on_5year_interval as

ORDER BY  age
)

select *
from s1 join  s2 on s1.age=s2.age

4)find male , female and totalsuicides by country

WITH C AS

FROM suicide_rates
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_suicides DESC),

(SELECT country , SUM(suicide_no) as total_female_suicides
FROM suicide_rates
WHERE sex = 'female'
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_female_suicides DESC)

SELECT C.country, C.total_suicides, C2.total_male_suicides,C3.total_female_suicides
FROM C JOIN C2 ON C.country = C2.country JOIN C3 ON C2.country= C3.country
GROUP BY C.country, C.total_suicides, C2.total_male_suicides,C3.total_female_suicides
ORDER BY C.total_suicides DESC

5)find male , female and totalsuicides by year

WITH C AS
(SELECT year , SUM(suicide_no) as total_suicides
FROM suicide_rates
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY total_suicides DESC),

C2 AS 
(SELECT year , SUM(suicide_no) as total_male_suicides
FROM suicide_rates
WHERE sex = 'male'
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY total_male_suicides DESC),

C3 AS
(SELECT year , SUM(suicide_no) as total_female_suicides
FROM suicide_rates
WHERE sex = 'female'
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY total_female_suicides DESC)

SELECT C.year, C.total_suicides, C2.total_male_suicides,C3.total_female_suicides
FROM C JOIN C2 ON C.year = C2.year JOIN C3 ON C2.year= C3.year
GROUP BY C.year, C.total_suicides, C2.total_male_suicides,C3.total_female_suicides
ORDER BY C.total_suicides DESC


--> Power Bi

Made a dashboard using analysis from SQL 
while comparing MALE and FEMALE suicides rates by year , country , intervals
and added a world map showing total suicides in different countries
